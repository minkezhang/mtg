# Yusri, Fortune's Flame

## Combos

1. with [[Ral, Storm Conduit]] on the board, [[Fork]] + [[Fork]]
1. with [[Twinning Staff]] on the board, [[Lightning Bolt]] + [[Fork]] + [[Fork]] \
Here, the first [[Fork]] instance targets [[Lightning Bolt]], and the second [[Fork]] targets the first. Once the second instance resolves, two more [[Fork]] copies are added onto the stack. Both of these copies may still target the first instance, creating four copies, and so forth. Growth is `POW(2, N)`.
1. [[Twinflame]] + [[Dualcaster Mage]] \
Target [[Twinflame]] with [[Dualcaster Mage]]. When trigger resolves, use the copied [[Twinflame]] and target the [[Dualcaster Mage]], creating an arbitrarily large number of creatures with haste.
1. with [[Twinning Staff]] on the board and [[Dramatic Reversal]] on the stack, activate the staff's copy ability \
This produces an arbitrarily large amount of mana on the stack and for the current step / phase.
1. with [[Isochron Sceptor]] on the board copying [[Dramatic Reversal]], cast [[Comet Storm]] \
[[Isochron Sceptor]] and [[Dramatic Reversal]] combos by creating an arbitrarily large amount of mana. This may be used as ramp for any other combo, or sank into [[Comet Storm]] to finish the game.

## Mulligan

* as many [[Fork]] and / or [[Counterspell]] instances as possible
* as much draw as possible

## Strategy

Ramp and draw T1 - T2. Cast [[Yusri, Fortune's Flame]] by T3 and start attacking on T4, continuing to ramp and draw. Use [[Counterspell]] and removal to keep board state manageable and protect [[Yusri, Fortune's Flame]]. Typical goldfish win by T7.

* Early instances of [[Fork]] should be judiciously used to clone ramp, advantage, or removal spells.
* Try to get [[Yusri, Fortune's Flame]] on the board with some form of protection in hand -- may want to risk casting as soon as there is enough mana on the board and rely on protection in future turns.
* It's okay to let [[Yusri, Fortune's Flame]] die after a while, especially if most combo pieces are in hand.
* Board state is a key weakness. Use the plethora of [[Stern Dismissal]] instances to bounce key pieces and slow down opponent board states.
