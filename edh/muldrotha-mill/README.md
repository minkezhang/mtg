# Restrictions

**Rule 0: Win conditions should have potential for player interaction, i.e. "the deck is fun to play with and against."**

For casual play per Rule 0, we will not include the following cards --

* [[Leveler]] -- limited opponent interaction with [[Laboratory Maniac]] etc.
* [[Demonic Consultation]] -- limited opponent interaction with [[Laboratory Maniac]] etc.
* [[Luxior, Giada's Gift]] -- infinite mana generation with [[Devoted Druid]]
* [[Machine God's Effigy]] -- infinite mana generation with [[Devoted Druid]]
* [[Torment of Hailfire]] -- does not fit the deck theme
* [[Villainous Wealth]] -- does not fit the deck theme
* [[Cyclonic Rift]] -- does not fit the deck theme
* [[Ashiok, Dream Render]] -- limits opponent interaction
* [[Dauthi Voidwalker]] -- limits opponent interaction, nonbos with [[Scavenging Ooze]]
* [[Lotus Petal]] -- infinite mill combo with [[Muldrotha]], [[Altar of Dementia]], and [[Kaya's Ghostform]]
* [[Cabal Coffers]]

This list is not exhaustive.

While not a hard rule, the deck attempts to limit the number of expensive cards (i.e. pay-to-win). For example, [[Crucible of Worlds]] is currently the most expensive card in this deck and does a lot of ramp and is a thematic fit, which justifies its cost. [[Jeweled Lotus]] and [[Mox Diamond]] seem unfair to play in a casual deck with the average income.

* [[Hermit Druid]] replaced with [[Satyr Wayfinder]]
* [[The Meathook Massacre]] replaced with [[Terror Tide]]
* [[Thassa's Oracle]] replaced with [[Laboratory Maniac]]
* [[Kokusho, the Evening Star]] (similar [[Syr Konrad, the Grim]], [[Massacre Wurm]])
* [[Phyrexian Altar]] replaced with [[Ashnod's Altar]]
* [[Phyrexian Tower]]
* [[Boseiju, Who Endures]]
* [[Vesuva]] replaced with [[Thespian's Stage]]
* [[Vampiric Tutor]]
* [[Demonic Tutor]]

This list is not exhaustive.

# Weaknesses

## Player Error

There will be some uncertainty on choosing a specific path to the win condition in the mid-game.

## Win Condition

Engine core may be too slow -- main buff / nerf target should be adjusting the ramp speed to match table.

## Speed

Most cards are played at sorcery speed and there are not a lot of instant-speed counter-like abilities.

## Self-Mill

Especially if playing without [[Underrealm Lich]], the effects of [[Grim Haruspex]], [[River Kelpie]], etc. allows draw control to pass to opponents.

## Tokens

Board wipes will have a difficult time dealing with token generators which have some parts already assembled, e.g. stable 5 / 5 token sources. [[Spore Frog]] may not be good enough to handle multiple turns of damage.

## Face Burn

The deck lacks answers to direct damage to face (e.g. burns), with only [[Angel of Suffering]] serving as incidental protection. Other targeted removals, e.g. [[Haywire Mite]] may be of use, but value is not guaranteed.

# Footnotes

<sup>1</sup> Alternatively, replace [[Altar of Dementia]] with [[Shadowheart, Dark Justiciar]] to decrease power level. Chose [[Altar of Dementia]] because it helps ramp [[Matzalantli, the Great Door]].

<sup>2</sup> Infect is another viable win condition enabler; however, the deck promotes swinging with very large Timmies, and infect enables winning with smaller creatures. Infect has more trouble with token decks, which is already a weakness with the current deck as well.

<sup>3</sup> This combo is uncomfortably close to generating infinite mana. May play with house errata

```
Devoted Druid cannot gain +1 / +1 counters. If Devoted Druid were to be removed from the battlefield, exile Devoted Druid instead.
```

or

```
Devoted Druid is also a Human.
```

or replace [[Devoted Druid]] and [[Mikaeus, the Unhallowed]] with [[Ashnod's Coupon]] and [[Assault Suit]], which seems more fun.

<sup>4</sup> Alternatively, replace [[Terror Tide]] with [[The Meathook Massacre]]. Chose [[Terror Tide]] due to arbitrary cost restrictions.

<sup>5</sup> May add [[Liquimetal Torque]] as an enabler.

<sup>6</sup> Recursion may make this an unfun combo. May play with house errata

```
Strip Mine may only target lands the controller owns.
```

<sup>7</sup> May nerf with a variety of other lands.

<sup>8</sup> Alternatively, replace [[Prime Speaker Zegana]] or [[River Kelpie]] with [[Underrealm Lich]] to triple effective draw rate instead while keeping CMC steady.

<sup>9</sup> May nerf with [[Sheoldred, Whispering One]] to provide more opportunities for opponent interaction by slowing down recursion, or with [[Braids, Arisen Nightmare]] to lower CMC.

<sup>10</sup> "Pay life" mechanics are not considered damage.

<sup>11</sup> Artifact / enchantment removal can be very urgent; this deck has multiple ways of bringing back creatures, but only one way to recur enchantments. We chose [[Caustic Caterpillar]] over [[Seal of Primordium]] because of this.

<sup>12</sup> The [[Muldrotha, the Gravetide]] which is resurrected by [[Kaya's Ghostform]] is a new instance, which means it can cast another cycle of permanents.
